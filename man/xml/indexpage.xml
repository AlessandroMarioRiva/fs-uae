 Its purpose is to reproduce the hardware of the original system, so that software written for the emulated machine &quot;does not notice&quot; the difference between the real and the virtual machine created by the emulator, and then &quot;turns&quot; just like on the original system. </para><sect2 id="index_1AmigaDOS">
<title>AmigaDOS Beer: a brief &quot;story&quot; of Amiga.</title>
<para>The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an import. This beer never really sold very well because the original manufacturer didn’t understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a 16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz. cans too. When this can was originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design hasn’t changed much over the years, so it appears dated now. Critics of this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway. </para></sect2>
